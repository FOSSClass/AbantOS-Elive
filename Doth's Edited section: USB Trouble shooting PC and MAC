+USB Booting Issues
+
+Did you have an issue when your PC did not boot the external flash drive USB even after going to Bios and selecting appropriate device? Did an Error message popped up saying something along the lines of "device is not found"? What do you do?
+
+After you install what ever that it is you want on your external flash drive USB you may find out that you are finding some trouble getting it to work. This means something needs to be configured in the BIOS to allow the external flash drive USB to be recognized and booted. Once this is complete, your external hard drive USB device should now be able to run and work.
+
+Some computers boot immediately from the internal hard drive by default, which ignores any bootable devices unless it is instructed to do otherwise. Some computers may use UEFI motherboards instead of the tradional BIOS. This all depends on the operating system, as it may support either UEFI or BIOS. 
+
+UEFI motherboards support what is called legacy boot, which allows the computer to boot external devices instead of the internal default.
+
+Here are the steps to to configure UEFI/Legacy Boot:
+
+* Begin by inserting the Flash drive USB to a USB port. 
+
+* Restart the computer by choosing to restart using the mouse, or by simply pressing the power button on the keyboard.
+
+* While the computer is beginning to boot up, continuously press the F12 key until the Boot Menu comes up. 
+
+If nothing happens, or it didn't work, you may need to enter the BIOS and configure the settings to see the boot menu.
+
+* Once again, you may need to restart the computer. THIS time, instead of pressing the F12, you'll want to press the F1 Key. 
+This will allow you to enter the BIOS. 
+
+You'll want to look for anything regarding UEFI/Legacy Boot. 
+
+* Once you find that, change the settings to enable or on. If theres and option for both, you may want to set that as well. (otherwise you'd have to change the setting back to what it was, in order to boot by default the internal hard drive (SSD)) 
+
+* Then after you do that you'll have to change the priority. Look for anything regarding the Priority and set or enable the settings to Legacy first. This will allow the external flash drive to boot first instead of the default internal hard drive (SDD)
+
+* Exit the menu and restart the computer either by choosing the restart options, or by powering off using the power button.
+
+You should now be able to boot via external flash drive USB.
